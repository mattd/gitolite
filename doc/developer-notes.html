<h3>general stuff</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>all scripts and libraries must be in the same directory.  However, RPM/DEB
packagers can put the libraries where they want, as long as they can be
found in perl's default <code>@INC</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>gl-auth-command <strong>requires</strong> an actual <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> (except if your
initials are "JK" or "DG", in which case <code>/etc/gitolite/gitolite.rc</code> also
works!)  It knows how to look around and set env vars etc correctly</p></li>
<li><p>all programs except gl-auth-command <strong>require</strong> the environment variables
<code>GL_RC</code> and <code>GL_BINDIR</code> set properly.  Your best bet is to run them <em>via</em>
gl-auth-command, like so:</p>

<pre><code>path/to/gl-auth-command -e other_program other_program_arguments
</code></pre>

<p>In any case none of these programs are meant to be run manually -- pretty
much all of them are run via gl-auth-command or from something that was
forked from it so the variables <em>will</em> exist during normal operation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_the_rc_file"></a></p>

<h3>the rc file</h3>

<p>The 'rc' file has one major change from v1: any new values in the rc file need
to be added to the @EXPORT list in <code>src/gitolite_rc.pm</code>.</p>

<p><a name="_modules"></a></p>

<h3>modules</h3>

<p>There are 3 "modules" (<code>gitolite_rc</code>, <code>gitolite_env</code>, and <code>gitolite</code> itself).
Their purposes should be fairly obvious.</p>

<p><a name="_that_bindir_thing"></a></p>

<h3>that 'bindir' thing</h3>

<p>The importance of <code>GL_BINDIR</code> is that the command= argument in
<code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> must be a full path, ideally, and the compile script
gets this from <code>GL_BINDIR</code>.</p>

<p><a name="_from_perl"></a></p>

<h4>from perl</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>for frequently run perl programs, I prefer my method</p>

<ul>
<li>gl-auth-command -- this is invoked with a full path</li>
<li>gl-mirror-shell -- same as above</li>
<li>gl-time -- same as above</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>"their" ideal is "FindBin".  I will use it only on manually or
infrequently run programs</p>

<ul>
<li>gl-setup-authkeys (external shim to compile keys separately from PTA)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_from_shell"></a></p>

<h4>from shell</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>a perl program called gl-query-rc finds its own BINDIR (using my perl
method, not FindBin).  This is suitable for calling from shell scripts
as <code>${0%/*}/gl-query-rc GL_BINDIR</code></p>

<ul>
<li>gl-setup</li>
<li>gl-tool</li>
<li>gl-mirror-push</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_OUTLIER_"></a></p>

<h4>OUTLIER!</h4>

<ul>
<li>gl-admin-push is an outlier.  For some silly reason I have the notion that
even if it runs from /tmp it should get the right values, so it is the
only one that interrogates <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> to get the actual
BINDIR in use!</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_special_types_of_setups"></a></p>

<h3>special types of setups</h3>

<p><a name="_Fedora"></a></p>

<h4>Fedora</h4>

<p>Fedora has a very special setup, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>each user has his own userid and login</li>
<li>his/her ~/.ssh/authkeys file (containing only his/her key) has a
"command=" clause invoking gl-auth-command</li>
<li><p>trusted users have "gl-auth-command -s" meaning they can get a shell if
they want to</p></li>
<li><p>actual git repos are under "git" (or some such), and include the chmod g+s
(git init --shared) unix perms tricks for shared access</p></li>
<li><p>but since they're coming through gl-auth, branch-level acls are in effect</p></li>
<li><p>the gitolite config file is generated from some database and compiled (all
via cron)</p></li>
<li><p>the keydir/ is empty; in fact they probably don't use the admin repo at
all, AFAIK</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important implication of this setup is that <strong>the RC file is no
longer is <code>$HOME</code> of the 'git' user</strong>.  They keep it in
<code>/etc/gitolite/gitolite.rc</code>.  This means that a properly setup rc file must
already be present in <code>/etc/gitolite/gitolite.rc</code> before doing any such
installs.</p>

<hr />

<h1><strong>Why v2?</strong></h1>

<p>I went onto <code>#perl</code> to ask some question about setpriority() and got yelled at
for writing "horrible code".  And that was one of the kinder comments; my
rather fragile ego is trying to forget the rest ;-)</p>

<p>They also gave me a link to a PDF book, "Modern Perl" by 'chromatic'.  Nice
book; one of the first things you learn from it is that you should not go to
<code>#perl</code> for general help.</p>

<p>Anyway, the summary of the collective angst of <code>#perl</code> (well 2 people anyway)
was: use Getopt::Long, FindBin, 'use lib', a library for HTTP stuff, stop
prefixing subs with '&amp;', and get rid of the huge number of 'our' declarations.</p>

<p>That last item is the only one I totally agree with, because it was on my long
term todo list anyway.  And 'use lib' sorta goes with it, so that's fine too.
And as soon as I found that vim colors the sub names differently if you take
out the '&amp;' I decided I'd do that too :-) [But honestly, if <code>&amp;sub</code> is so bad
shouldn't "man perlsub" at least say something negative about it, other than
"disables prototype checking", which doesn't matter here since I'm not using
prototypes?]</p>

<p>As for the rest, FindBin brings in a good 1000+ lines for something that I do
in a line or two (since I don't care about all the pathological edge cases).
Getopt::Long is 2649 lines to replace the code below  [note that there <em>is</em>
only one possible option to this command, and it is <em>never</em> run manually
either, so I don't need any fancy features]:</p>

<pre><code>my $shell_allowed = 0;
if (@ARGV and $ARGV[0] eq '-s') {
    $shell_allowed = 1;
    shift;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently TMTOWTDI has given way to TOOWTDI.</p>

<p>Anyway, I spent a few hours refactoring it.  And I do thank them for pushing
me to stop being lazy on the "our" business.</p>
